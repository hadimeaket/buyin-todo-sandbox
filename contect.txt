Prompt 0 – Project context

You are my senior full stack engineer pair programmer.
We will build a small but clean and well structured “Todo” web application suitable as a sandbox project in an enterprise environment.

Requirements

Monorepo structure with two subfolders
– backend
– frontend

Backend
– Node.js with TypeScript
– Express or a similar minimal framework
– Clean architecture with separation of routes, controllers, services and models
– Simple in memory data store for todos is enough, but structure the code so that a database could be added later
– REST API for CRUD operations on todos

Frontend
– React with TypeScript
– Simple but clean UI for todo list management
– Uses the backend REST API

Containerization
– Dockerfile for backend
– Dockerfile for frontend
– docker-compose.yml to run both services together

General constraints
– Use npm as the package manager
– Use a current LTS Node version compatible with TypeScript
– Use a consistent code style and add basic scripts in package.json
– Whenever you propose changes, show me complete files not only snippets, so that I can copy paste them

Acknowledge that you understand and wait for my first concrete task.
